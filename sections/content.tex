\chapter{Security Analysis}
\label{Security Analysis}

This section contains an overview of threats and how, if so, TDX protects against them. This analysis is by no means comprehensive, but meant as an overview. In addition ways to establish a secure connection to a TD are discussed.
\section{The Threat Model}


\subsection{Threads TDX does not protect against}

\subsubsection{Side-Channel Attacks}

Side-Channel Attacks are attacks that take advantage of unintended output channels of a system. The first one according to \cite{zhou_side-channel_nodate} which in turn references Wright et Al., was when in 1965 MI5 tried to decipher a cryptography device used in the Egyptian Embassy. To reduce the computational effort, they listened to the setting of the device through a microphone placed close to a window, and thus deduced the position of some of the machine's rotors.
By their nature TDX can not protect against all Side-Channel attacks, but importantly, it is effective against all currently known forms of the "Spectre-Family" attacks. Explicitly outside the scope of TDX are computation-time and power-analysis attacks, as well as power-glitches and physical fault injections.

\subsection{Vulnerable Applications}

The Operating System is part of the \Gls{TCB} but is not under the control of the TDX creators or developers. Any issue within an \Gls{OS} can cause issues within a \Gls{TD}. This would also happen with a server that is hosted by yourself and not offshore and is thus not being protected against. Similarly, any security issue within an outward facing application within a \Gls{TD} is a security issue that can not be fixed by using TDX. This means that an application inside a TD is only as secure as the application itself. 

The threat model does not address any threats made possible by the TDX guest userspace directly using TDVMCALL hypercalls (through the TDX-module) and shared memory for IO exposed to an untrusted host/VMM. If TDX guest userspace enables debug or test tools that can read memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) or PCI configuration space without validating the input from untrusted host/VMM, it opens up the possibility of many more attacks. In addition malicious input from, for example,  PortIO, SharedMemory or KVM Hypercalls to non-robust device drivers can lead to threats from inside the TD, although Intel has provided mitigation measures against those \cite{linux-guest-hardening}.


Intel has published a white paper \cite{noauthor_tdx-whitepaper-february2022pdf_nodate} which contains an overview of what TDX is designed to mitigate. The TCB is very conservative only containing 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intel TDX module, with Persistent Seam Loader (P-SEAMLDR)
    \item Intel Authenticated Code Modules (ACM)
    \item TD Quoting Enclave (SGX)
    \item Intel CPU Hardware
\end{itemize}
All other system components are outside of the TCB, including the BIOS, SMM, host OS, and the VMM. Some physical attacks such as cold-boot and DRAM traffic are also supposedly protected against. This threat model also assumes the KVM/Qemu to be the hypervisor running the protected TDX guest \cite{aktas_intel_nodate}.

\subsection{Adversarial Goals}
An attacker targeting TDX or a TD directly can focus on different components, depending on what their goals are. In general, they would be interested in leaking sensitive data or disrupting the expected behavior of a TD.

\myparagraph{Leaking TD Secrets}

Once the TD has been verified via attestation, the third party owner of the TD is expected to provide confidential information to the TD. This could take the form of cryptographic keys, private user data, or similar. TDX aims to isolate this information from any malicious third party. If any attacks exist the Host, neighbouring TDs or someone with hardware access could potentially extract this information.

\myparagraph{Manipulating TD Behavior}

An adversary may be looking to change the behavior of a victim TD in various ways. This could be done through direct memory or register corruption, which would cause unexpected behavior or control of execution. As previously discussed the VMM can change some memory mappings the TD uses, which could lead to changes in the behavior of the application. More subtle ways to do this involve changing the I/O to the TD or even abuse the scheduler for this. 

\myparagraph{Host Denial-of-Service}

An adversary may aim to limit the availability of a cloud provider by obstructing the scheduling of other workloads (TDs, VMs) on a machine. This can also be achieved by abusing the scheduler. Additional attacks can vary in their severity. For instance, a bug in a TD may lead to its shutdown, while a bug in the TDX module could necessitate an immediate halt of all TDs on the machine. Some memory states can cause unrecoverable machine checks which necessitates a full power cycle to recover\cite{aktas_intel_nodate}.

\subsection{Attack Vectors and Vulnerabilities}

The TCB for Intel TDX has a restricted number of system components, which creates only a few opportunities for adversaries to breach system security. Moreover, when a malicious Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) and a malicious TD work together, they can exploit complex scenarios that the system designers may not have foreseen. The following will give a quick summary of the attack vectors from \cite{aktas_intel_nodate} and then give an additional vector that is the main focus of this thesis.  


\myparagraph{MCHECK, exiting the Bios safely}

With TDX and its predecessor SGX the BIOS is situated entirely outside the TCB. This results in the system requiring a mechanism to ensure that the BIOS has configured all security-sensitive settings to be within an acceptable range. Intel has developed MCHECK, not to be confused with the malloc debugging tool, to provide this insurance and provide results to TDX in a trusted way.  MCHECK is embedded within the CPU microcode update file, which is encrypted and signed by Intel. This ensures that only Intel can execute microcode updates but it makes this a completely opaque security validation. MCHECK code is not made public by Intel. According to Intel MCHECK verifies \guillemotright all logical cpus to ensure they meet TDX's security and certain functionality requirements \guillemotleft\cite[p.~50]{noauthor_tdx-module-10-public-specpdf_nodate} and then provides an overview of general hardware information to Non-Persistant SEAM Loader (NP-SEAMLDR) and P-SEAMLDR. 

\myparagraph{NP-SEAMLDR and P-SEAMLDR}

Since the BIOS code for the startup is outside of the \gls{TCB}, there needs to be a method to establish a root of trust on which the rest of the TDX infrastructure can be loaded. For TDX the already existing TXT and Authenticated Code Modules were extended to create a new Authenticated Code Module name NP-SEAMLDR \cite{intel_corporation_intel_TXT_nodate}. The OS loads NP-SEAMLDR which validates the system configuration and installs P-SEAMLDR into the \Gls{SEAMRR} memory regions and then returns control to the OS. NP-SEAMLDR prevents calls from the BIOS progressing beyond the entry code, meaning the BIOS can not execute code while after this state. All guest VMs and TDs have to trigger a VM exit for all \Gls{GETSEC} instructions. This leaves a very limited BIOS, the OS/VMM and SMM as attack vectors into NP-SEAMLDR. An issue, in a previous version, found by Aktas et Al. allowed an attacker to have free control over the Instruction Pointer while in privileged AC mode thus allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands \cite{aktas_intel_nodate}. This is fixed now but arbitrary command execution would completely subvert any trust in the \Gls{TD} without being visible to a challenger. P-SEAMLDR after it was installed then installs the main TDX module serially on all logical processors. This creates a chain of trust from MCHECK to the TDX Module and then later on to the TD \cite{intel_corporation_intel_seam_2023}. 

\myparagraph{\Gls{TDX Module}}

The TDX module is the central privileged software component for running TDs. P-SEAMLDR installs the module and runs it in SEAM Root Mode giving it full access to the host OS and all TDs. The TDX module could be attacked either from a malicious TD or a malicious Host. A malicious TD is by design not able to affect other TDs so this attack vector is not as important. Taking over the TDX module or being able to execute any code would make any attestation or security guarantee useless. The security attestation only covers if the TDX module is executed correctly and if the code is signed by Intel. If this code has exploitable faults, the attestation does nothing to help the user.

\myparagraph{Outside connection to the TD}

The last major interface is the outside connection to the TD. Here two different problems arise. Firstly transport data security. Making sure that data is not compromised in transit is technically not part of the threats TDX wants to protect against and it does not do that but it will be a major concern of this thesis. The second issue that comes up is making sure that communication is done with the correct TD. TD identity checking is explicitly outside the scope of TDX but it can help with that and this will be another concern in this thesis. The TDX attestation only guarantees that somewhere a TD runs on certified hardware with a signed TDX Module version. Additional information the Quote can supply will be needed to identify a TD. An exemplary man-in-the-middle attack is shown in \ref{fig:man_in_the_middle}.
\begin{figure}
   \centering
       \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{figures/Man-In-The-Middle.png} 
 \caption{A simple man-in-the-middle attack against a TD. The attacker reroutes the challenge to an unsecured VM, which in turn requests a quote from a different TD}
 \label{fig:man_in_the_middle}
\end{figure}
Provided that security promises within the previously mentioned parts of the TCB are solid, connecting to and verifying the identity of a \Gls{TD} is the last step towards secure computation with user Input.

\section{Connecting to the correct TD}

This section proposes three different ways to establish a secure connection, which get increasingly more complex, while reducing security assumptions and increasing adherence to best practices.

\myparagraph{Verifying the TD identity}

\label{Identity}
Similarly to SGX, with TDX the quote contains information on the startup environment of the TD. The Measurement of Trust Domain (MRTD) registers contain information on the initial state of the TD immediately after startup \cite{intel_corporation_dcap_2024-1}. The Runtime Measurement Registers (RTMR) are written during the runtime, Intel recommends writing information about the virtual firmware configuration in RTMR[0] and information about the OS kernel and boot parameters or more importantly kernel parameters in RTMR[1]. Additionally the Quote can contain informal data in the \textbf{REPORTDATA} field, which could for example contain hashes about the current state of the filesystem. The developer has to compare the expected state of the TD with the real state themself. As explained in \ref{sec:Foundations:ConfComputing} Linux can leverage IMA to measure the integrity of its file system. IMA can be used alongside ARM Trustzone for runtime integrity measurement for applications located in edge appliances and client appliances \cite{song_tz-ima_arm_2022} and has subsequently also been integrated in Intel TDX. This requires changes to the Linux Kernel to use the correct runtime measurement registers, as long as vTPM is not supported by TDX. The records of the event logs related to the list of measurements will be kept in the Confidential Computing Event Log (CCEL) table \cite{haidong_xia_runtime_integrity_measurement_2024}. 

\subsection{Establishing a secure connection to the TD}

\label{Establishing_a_secure_connection}

\myparagraph{Simple SSH connection to a TD}

\label{SSHConnection}
After creation the TD contains a previously supplied public key. This is generally put into the image prior to boot and if it is the only key present and password authentication is deactivated, the TD will decline connection attempts by anyone without the corresponding private key. This being the only key present can be verified via measurements in the TD Quote as discussed previously. If possible the startup measurements should be compared to a selfbuild image containing just the users public key. If the user is the only person being able to access this specific TD then this means that it is no longer possible to fake the man-in-the-middle attack in Figure \ref{fig:man_in_the_middle} because the attacker would not have access to a TD that can create the correct quote. This form of secure communication relies on the fact that only one public key is in the TD and thus the initial communication channel is secure. If somehow the initial communication channel can be compromised this is no longer secure. It also depends on the user to verify the TDs identity upon connecting and also for subsequent connection attempts that the fingerprint of the TDs can not be recreated for transcript collision attacks \cite{bhargavan_transcript_2016}.

\myparagraph{SSL connection to a TD}

According to \cite{cheng_intel_2023} TDX and SGX can establish secure channels via SSL in a similar way:
In a typical scenario, when a client negotiates a secure channel with a server running in a TD, it aims to ensure a connection with a server that has been properly instantiated. The server, acting as an attester, generates a pair of ephemeral public and private keys. It calculates the hash of the public key and creates a TD report that includes this hash as the \textbf{REPORTDATA}. The server then requests a quote of the report and generates a self-signed certificate with the quote embedded in it. This self-signed certificate is provided as the server certificate in the TLS handshake protocol. Upon receiving the server certificate, the client, acting as the challenger, verifies the signatures on the certificate and validates the embedded quote, including the measurements. The client also checks if the quote includes the hash of the public key, as this associates the key with the TD. This contains the assumption that the client can verify the TD identity from the Quote, which is not given. When establishing a secure channel, both the client and server can assume the roles of attester and verifier. This enables endpoints running in TDs to authenticate each other mutually by validating TDs\cite{knauth_integrating_2019}. Issues arising from self-signed certificates, the certificate size and similar are discussed as well, with all of them  having solutions. This form of secure communication relies on certificate authorities and can thus also work if the initial communication channel is compromised. Although the latter can mean that the entire TD can be compromised which invalidates other security assumptions. They thus have similar security assumptions and guarantees. This is also the way Intel does TD migration in their  TD migration guide\cite{intel_corporation_td_migration_design_2023} which in turn also relies on \cite{knauth_integrating_2019}.
Lastly an add-on to the previous method of establishing a secure connection is the usage of a complete application in the image, that does only expose certain endpoints to the web. Using proper authorisation against those endpoints, makes unwarranted access impossible. Additionally, having the application immediately on startup create the necessary certificate from the previous paragraph, prevents attacks on the initial connection as well. This is Intels recommended way of using TDX and starting a TD. 

\myparagraph{Using Initramfs and encrypted disk images}

Using a custom Kernel with a custom Initramfs that mounts an encrypted disk and contains TDX attestation capabilities as well as a predetermined public SSH key, it is possible to establish a secure connection as well. This relies on the same mechanisms as \ref{SSHConnection} but gives the additional guarantee, that the Kernel loaded has to be the one supplied by the user. It can also safeguard sensitive data inside the image from unauthorized access. Upon startup the TD will pause the start prior after the Kernel has been loaded. The Initramfs will be loaded and active here as well. The challenger can now use its private key to the public ssh key inside the Initramfs to establish a secure connection. The challenger can now create a TD quote containing the Kernel measurements. Verifying the kernel measurements inside the TD quote and can then supply the key to the encrypted disk image to continue booting. It is also possible to use the Storage-Volume-Key-Location ACPI Table in the virtual firmware for this \cite{uefi_forum_inc_acpi_docu_2022}. Intel recommends implementation of these tables in their design guide \cite{intel_corporation_tdx-virtual-firmware-design-guide-rev-004-20231206pdf_2023}. If disk encryption is used, LUKS provides the ability to use disk encryption with authentication. It is now guaranteed that the image inside the encrypted disk image is now executed only once and is running inside a TD. Choosing a secure channel to this TD depends on the code inside. Having an additional SSH key inside, as explained previously, can work.

\section{Attestation Verification}

There are generally four ways how attestation can be done that have their pros and cons. They are outlined in \cref{tab:AttestationVerification}.

}
\caption{Overview of four different Attestation Verification methods}
\label{tab:AttestationVerification}
\end{table}
This thesis will focus on Cloud Provider Attestation Service, and more specifically Microsoft Azure Attesation (MAA). The security assumptions and guarantees for this will then be compared to a Build-Your-Own Service using DCAP. MAA also has to use DCAP to generate and verify quotes.

\subsection{Cloud Provider Attestation Service}
 Microsoft, as do most other cloud providers, offers an attestation verification service hosted by them. They also offer an implementation of Intel DCAP, which can be used to generate a quote and automatically verify it via MAA or Intel Trust Authority. The latter was not available for testing.

\myparagraph{Microsoft Azure Attestation}

This section will explain in detail how MAA can be used, the pitfalls and issues with it. Microsoft supplies a tutorial to create a TD VM at  \cite{chasecrum_github_create_2024}, which does not create a TD, that has the characteristics discussed in \cref{TDX Architecture}. Issues with the used TD as well as the firmware are explored in \ref{Issues-with-azure-td}. Following the instructions provided by Azure, it is also not explained how to choose between AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX. This decision is entirely up to the chosen VM size which can only be inferred by looking at press releases pertaining Intel TDX and the newly released VM sizes. The DC\textbf{e}sv5, DC\textbf{e}dsv5 and EC\textbf{e}sv5, EC\textbf{e}dsv5 use Intel Xeon CPUs, while DC\textbf{a}sv5, DC\textbf{a}dsv5 and EC\textbf{a}sv5, EC\textbf{a}dsv5 use AMD Threadripper CPUs.The difference between D-instances and E-instances is the ratio between VCPU cores and memory, with E-instances having more memory per core. With the VM created there are a couple of ways to create a TD Quote for attestation: Using an Intel-supplied or a self-written implementation of Intel DCAP and the Azure confidential-computing-cvm-guest-attestation library \cite{microsoft_corporation_azureconfidential-computing-cvm-guest-attestation_nodate}. Building the tdx-attestation app and using the supplied maa\_config file, which does only contain three settings, succeeds in creating a TD quote and then returns a JSON Web Token from the Microsoft Azure attestation Service. The entire decoded token can be found in \ref{jwt} but here we will focus on some parts of the td quote body. \cite{intel_corporation_dcap_2024-1} contains short explanation for all registers, which will be explained further. We know that this has to be TDX 1.5 because tdx\_mrseam is not filled with 0, which would indicate TDX 1.0. The TEE\_TCB\_INFO struct contains two measurements, which are expected to be non-zero: MRSEAM and TEE\_TCB\_SVN, one that has to be 0 with TDX: MRSIGNERSEAM and one that can be either: TD\_ATTRIBUTES. These all fit. Intels recommendation for runtime-measurement registers tdx\_rtmr0 and tdx\_rtmr1 are as follows: RTMR0 stores the measurements for TD Virtual Firmware, these are influenced by tdvm launch parameters, such as memory size. Most importantly this is locked in during startup and thus not user controlled in a cloud environment, although those can be overwritten, those changes would be present in the ACPI CC log table \cite{uefi_forum_inc_acpi_docu_2022}. In the excerpt returned by MAA this is filled with 0. RTMR1 should have two different purposes, depending on the boot option for the VM . With a direct boot it stores the kernel measurements and cmdline, that is passed to the kernel. With a grub boot it stores the grub measurements \cite{intel_corporation_tdx-virtual-firmware-design-guide-rev-004-20231206pdf_2023}.  Both of those measurements are once again locked-in during the VM startup and out of control of the user. The register returned by MAA is once again only filled with 0, which is in itself not a violation of any standard but odd. The virtual firmware Intel offers for use does follow these instructions, meaning the firmware in use is a custom one by Microsoft which overwrites these best-practices. Especially RTMR1 with its Kernel measurements is invaluable to the identity verification measurements provided in \ref{Identity}.

\myparagraph{Issues with the Image and Firmware used in the Azure TD}

\label{Issues-with-azure-td}
For a TD to be present three different properties are necessary, although they are themselfs not sufficient to proof connection to a TD. In the file /proc/cpuinfo there needs to be a flag for tdx\_guest, this was false. The CC Event Log ACPI Table needs to contain CC Type 2 for TDX - this table was not even present, which is contrary to best efi best practices \cite{uefi_forum_inc_acpi_docu_2022}. Information from this table are also necessary for TD validation in general. The information from this would have also been present in the rtmr0 register. Lastly a pipe or character device called tdx\_guest, tdx-attestation or tdx-guest depending on the version should be present. These function as an interface to retrieve TDX-guest specific information\cite{linux_kernel_development_community_tdx_2024}. It is used to retrieve the TDREPORT for the attestation, covering steps 2 and 8 in Fig\ref{fig:QuoteGeneration}. This was also not present. This means that the Guest VM was neither a TDVM, nor is it compliant with other confidential computing VM standards. This itself does not make MAA hardware attestation impossible, but makes it much more difficult to implement your own attestation. It appears that Microsoft recreated the tdx\_guest interface somewhere but does not tell the user how it was done or if it was done exactly the same way. The User needs to recreate this pipe manually if they want to implement their own attestation. These pipes are not interchangeable between VMs of the same operating system. All of these changes go against the recommendations by the EFI specifications as well as Intels recommendations for TD implementations.
Verifying MAAs implementation is not possible as \guillemotright"Source code is [only] available for government customers via the Microsoft Code Center Premium Tool \guillemotleft \cite{dan_mabee_azure_attestation_2023}. It is not possible to supply your own image and the provided images by Azure do not have public hashes. Using the TDX IMA integration discussed in \ref{Identity} is also not possible with Azure in general.
The Azure attestation token is signed with a self-signed certificate, which was retrieved from \url{https://attestationprovidername.attest.azure.net/certs}, the signature does match. The same certificates contains the SGX quote from the azure attestation enclave, which was verified via the valid implementation of DCAP located at \cite{microsoft_corporation_azure-samplesmicrosoft-azure-attestation_nodate}. This confirms just that azure attestation runs inside a functioning SGX enclave. Additionally it is possible to validate the binding of the azure attestation SGX key with the key that signed the attestation token via the hash of the public key in the reportdata field of the quote. Lastly the Azure Attestation code measurements have to be validated. This was not done for this thesis, as this relies on the azure attestation teams notification for changes to MRSIGNER, which was deemed to be outside of the scope of this thesis.

Hosting your VMs bare metal on your own hardware will offer performance increases similar to the ones outlined in \ref{performance} as you can disable TDX completely. With security guarantees similar or better to the ones that TDX can offer.

\section{Setting up a TDX VM on a new machine}
\label{ch:SettingUpTDX}
Intel supplies documents for a quick setup of TDX machines and TDs. In this section, \cite{noauthor_white_nodate} will be used as a reference. Intel internally supplies additional documents as well and code from there will be replicated here if possible. The Server was supplied as an Intel DevCloud bare-metal machine with two Intel XEON 8490h processors with 60 cores respectively. Setting up Intel DevCloud and Trusted Domain for the first time took the better part of a week. The versioning in the different internal guides was off, which lead to an unusable kernel, which was only fixed by complete reinstall. The TDX-Toolversion used in the end was 2023ww22 from may 2023, which can be found at \cite{intel_corporation_inteltdx-tools_2024}. The guest image was created using the guest image creation tool. The entire BOM can be found in \cref{tab:BOM}

This installs all the necessary kernel components to the images, as well as checking the respective hashes. Next the host kernel has to be patched. This requires downloading the correct packages from the Intel open source directory and then simply creating a patched kernel. Next TDX can be enabled and booted up using the newly patched kernel. To enable the possibility of attestation, the kernel needs Intel SGX Data Center Attestation Primitive (DCAP), which can also be installed from the Intel open source directory or downloaded from Github. We also need an implementation of the Provisioning Certification Caching Service, which Intel provides a reference implementation of, which can also be found in the Intel open source directory. Lastly, the Quote Generation Service contained in the SGX SDK must be installed. Now the Guest TD can be booted up. For this the following QEMU parameters were used:

\section{Benchmarks}

\subsection{Benchmark and data evaluation methods}

\todo{how benchmarks were run}

In this thesis in general the Median Absolute Deviation opposed to the standard deviation will be used to compare different results. While the standard deviation is the de facto standard in the field of statistics it does not need to be \cite{Gorard}. The main benefit of the standard deviation was in the past its ease of calculation and when drawing from normal-distributed populations \guillemotright the standard deviation5 of their individual mean deviations is 14\% higher than the standard deviations of their individual standard deviations. \guillemotleft \cite{Gorard}
With most results it is generally expected to get something along a normal distribution but this assumption does not appear to be correct with memory benchmarks according to Lemire \url{https://lemire.me/blog/2023/04/06/are-your-memory-bound-benchmarking-timings-normally-distributed/}. With benchmarks having a strict lower limit of 0 we can expect to find right-skewed distributions instead. These large outliers will have a significant impact on the standard deviation, while they are not indicative of an actual slowdown from the measurements in question. Using a rather extreme example the Roberta AMX pipe using a short sentence array benchmark, although most Roberta AMX benchmarks showed these outliers, looks like shown in \cref{fig:histogramm}.
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Histogramm.png}

\label{fig:histogramm}
\end{figure}
A total of 2 out of 270 values were outliers but because some were so far outside the range 1.37s to 2.03s, the std dev was extremely high. Notably the longest run took 6.42 seconds almost 4 times as long as the mean. This one result increases the standard deviation from about 0.11 seconds to about 0.32 seconds. On the other hand the MAD only increases from about 0.03 to 0.04 seconds. The histogram clearly shows a clustering around about  1.65 seconds, which would not be appropriately represented by a standard deviation of 0.32 around the mean of 1.73 seconds.

\todo{General Benchmark results}

\subsection{Benchmark Results}
The Benchmark results using distilBERT-base-uncased show a small performance loss of 2\% from a TD VM to a Non-TD VM. The performance difference fluctuates between the non-TD VM being 3\% slower on the long sentence array transformer pipe to being 5\% faster on the long sentence AMX pipe. Half the benchmarks did not have a t-value that make them significant. For this test the 30 run times were run 3 times for a total of 90 test runs per benchmark. The AMX variant was on average 29\% faster with the differences ranging from 19\% to 50\% faster.
These differences can be seen using MAD and mean and standard deviation, meaning they are not only due to outliers. The first benchmarks had the TD VM about 18\% faster on average. This unexpected result meant running the tests two more times to remove any potential noises in the system. These closed the gap overall but only one suite had the expected outcome of the Non-TD VM running faster. See \ref{sec:appendix:benchmarks:bert} for the full results and \todo{add online archive for .json}.

The benchmark results using RoBERTa show a small performance loss of on average 1\% from a non-TD VM to a TD VM. The performance differs from about 5\% faster to 5\% slower. Each result was checked for significance using Student’s two-sample, two-tailed t-test with an alpha equal to 0.95. The absolute t-values range from 3.79 to 11.28. With 30 runs per test this results in p-values far below 0.01. Every result except 2 was faster on non-TD VMs. The AMX accelerated pipe was faster on the TD vm on the short sentence array and long sentences\todo{why}. So while theses tests are statistically significant the difference in speed is not significant for real-world applications. AMX vs Non-AMX showed a speed increase of about 30\% in this benchmark, this is in line with the expected 1/3 speed increase.
The full Benchmark results can be found in the Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:benchmarks:roberta}.

Both of the previous tests were done using an additional layer using a QEMU VM. Running the same benchmarks on the Host system directly averages an improvement of about 10\%. 
Due to the small margin between non-TD VMs and TD VM it was decided to test what disabling all TDX-related BIOS settings \cite{getting-started} would have as an impact. This showed a significant speedup of on average 24\% using distillbert and 44\% using Roberta. The highest speed-up with 78\% was observed on the short-sentence array using Roberta. The difference was measurably slower using the AMX pipe with the distilbert TDX-enabled AMX pipe on the long-sentence being 5\% faster even. This difference was still inside the standard deviation, so could reasonably be explained with variations in testing. On average the non-AMX benchmarks were 53\% faster using distillbert and 71\% faster using Roberta. Figure \ref{fig:distillbertMADNONAMX} clearly shows the speed difference after disabling TDX in the BIOS. 
\begin{figure}
   \centering
       \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{figures/distillbertMAD.png} 
 \caption{Test}
 \label{fig:distillbertMADNONAMX}
\end{figure}
On the other hand Figure \ref{fig:distillbertMADAMX} shows no measurable speed difference after disabling TDX using the AMX-enabled Benchmarks. 
\begin{figure}
   \centering
       \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{figures/distillbertMADAMX.png}

\end{figure}
The AMX benchmarks were, using the geometric mean, similar in speed using distillbert, with a difference that was not statistically significant. The AMX benchmarks using Roberta were about 21\% faster \todo{Roberta AMX results}. The overall speed-up was measurably faster than the initial observed AMX speedup, which indicates that this is not due to the omission of AMX in general but something different but having no speed-up using AMX with distillbert was an interesting result. \todo{herausfinden warum}
All prior tests were done using Ubuntu 22.04 and the next were done using Ubuntu 23.10 (from here on Ubuntu 23), because of instability issues. Rerunning the same tests using Ubuntu 23 the observed speed-up from a TD to TDX disabled diminished to just about 3\% with just TDX disabled and then an additional 3\% with memory-encryption disabled as well. These differences were small but the MAD on the measurements was even smaller, as can be seen in  \cref{fig:distillbertAMXUbuntu23}.

       \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{figures/inferencedistillberMADUbuntu23AMX.png} 
 \caption{Distillbert Inference times on Ubuntu 23 and Sapphire Rapid CPUs.Note: the apparent decrease in MAD is due to the logarithmic scale}
 \label{fig:distillbertAMXUbuntu23}
\end{figure}
A further examination was conducted on discernible execution time differences using a profiler on Ubuntu 23, but with just an eight percent speed difference, there wasn't much to observe. \todo{Profiler Analyse} Minus the speed overhead of the profiler which was measured to be about 10 seconds, no matter the platform, the execution took between 77 and 85 seconds, with the highest being TDX and memory encryption bypass enabled, which supposedly speeds up calculations, so assuming no impact here, the margin of error has to be at least the difference between memory encryption bypass enabled and disabled benchmarks, which is about two seconds or 2.5 percent. So no useful overall differences can be observed but some internal methods display significant differences. Intels Extension For Pytorch (IPEX) optimizer copy method saw timing increases of up to 400\%, this seems to be entirely due to activating TDX, as without TDX the timings were all within one percent of each other, enabling TDX without memory bypass increased this time by about 100\% and enabling bypass increases this a further 250\%. Total times for this IPEX optimization instruction can be seen in \ref{tab:IpexOpti}. The IPEX "replacement" method for linear transformation which takes most of the calculations shows small speed differences of about 5\% - in line with the rest. Almost all of the remaining speed differences came from basic linear transformation as well as the other methods called by the models. They show speed increases of about 5\% each.
Having a look at the profiler results on the Azure cloud there are no clear results on overall speed but noticeably the IPEX copy and optimize instructions were once again measurably slower on the TD compared to a non-TD VM the optimization took about 20\% longer on the TD. This slow down is almost completely due to the time PyTorches clone function takes, which saw increases of 1000\% in total and per call time. Memory encryption itself had close to no impact on the speed here. Neither did the Memory Encryption Bypass. Looking into the implementation of this function this is not expected. Clone creates shallow copies of a tensor, with the lower hierarchy memory being shared. With both the original and the copy being situated inside the TD, this should have at most the same overhead as raw memory access which is outlined in \ref{tab:MemoryAccessSpeed}.

Looking further into Host and Guest implementations of TDX on specific Ubuntu versions was deemed too much for this thesis.

\subsection{Benchmarking TDX parts}

As stated in the previous section there were significant speed differences between having TDX enabled and disabled in the Bios but basically none when TDX was enabled in the Bios but disabled in the VM. Further investigations into what causes these speed-ups were necessary. As stated in \ref{sec:tdxBuildingBlocks} there were essentially three functionalities that could be tested independently from TDX:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total Memory Encryption 
    \item Intel VT, virtualization features
    \item Intel SGX
\end{itemize}

They were tested in the order outlined here.
For Total Memory Encryption, TDX and SGX were disabled, while Intel VT remained turned on. Stream \cite{Stream} and "PerformanceTest" \url{PerformanceTest} were used for benchmarking. Stream is the de facto standard for memory speed testing and PerformanceTest is a commonly used proprietary tool used to compare memory access. Using PerformanceTest there were small but measurable differences in latency of about 5\% and 2.5\% for reading speed. The Writing speed remained within 1\% of each other.

\end{table}

With Stream, everything was tested disabled, just Memory Encryption enabled, and TDX completely enabled, and all three were within two percent of one another, with the encrypted memory being slightly faster than the other two. These results are most likely due to background noise of the system. \ref{fig:STREAM full results}

\subsection{Security Attestation}

Attestation was not implemented or usable on the Intel Developer Cloud. Verifying usage of TDX was thus relying on the Linux Kernel itself as well as Bios settings made by the user via an SSH connection. Without attestation the security benefits were theoretically not given. This was accepted as having bare-metal access meant being able to verify TDX activation directly.


\subsection{Setting up the benchmarks}
\label{sec:SecondContent:SecondSection}

The benchmark will be run in Python, as it is the most commonly used programming language in natural language processing. The benchmarks will predominantly be an inference benchmark using distillBERT and roBERTa-base, the code can be found in the appendix \ref{app:BenchmarkCode}. All benchmarks will be run using the same image on their own QEMU KVM with 32 Cores and 64GB of RAM on a machine containing 2 Intel Xeon 8490H with each 60 cores @1.90 Ghz, except if stated otherwise. The setup and boilerplate code can be found in the appendix aswell \ref{app:Setup}. Performance is measured with Pyperf and each test is run 30 times with the median and the standard deviation being shown.
For the inference Benchmark a short sentence with 16 tokens and a long sentence with 146 tokens were used. The long sentence was supposed to have 128 tokens but due to an oversight the sentence was a bit longer than initially thought. Additional more fine-grained benchmarks were done later on.

\section{Outlook}

This thesis focused on simple TDX implementations. With TDX having been just released, most of those implementations are still in their infancy and problems are to be expected. Hopefully in the future some of those, that have been highlighted in this thesis and those that have not been will be fixed. Nonetheless there are still additional things that can be looked at. The implementation of TDX in Ubuntu 22 appears to cause instability issues and also performance defiencies compared to the implementation in Ubuntu 23. Having a deeper look at the differences between those two could grant significant improvements. Additionally, comparisons between the different hardware Confidential Computing hardware providers are necessary to being able to make the decision for or against Confidential Computing. Additionally looking into the implementation of PyTorch to figure out why its copy function experiences such significant slowdown is advised. 

For the future Intel has planned on a cooperation with Nvidia to bring Confidential Computing and AI closer together \url{https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Products-and-Solutions/Security/Intel-Nvidia-Collaborate-to-Deliver-Confidential-AI-Solutions/post/1500066}. With the release of Intel attestation for Nvidia hardware to be planned in the first half of 2024, confidential computing on GPU hardware could be a possibility. Intel and Nvidia have yet to release architecture specifications for their collaboration but their security promises and assumptions will have to be tested then. If implementation could be simplified for the average user this could be a great step into the right direction for data security. The dangers of dedicated GPUs and the possible performance losses with establishing a secure communication between CPU and GPU are a challenge that will have to be solved first. Silberstein et al. highlighted the dangers of insecure communication and other problems with dedicated GPUs in their 2020 paper \cite{Silberstein_GPUAttack}.

Additionally this thesis was limited in regard to the amount of performancetesting that was feasible. More I/O heavy workloads and even some GPU-bound workloads could be tested. Implementing ways to calculate on a non-trusted GPU, while maintaining data confidentiality is still an ongoing line of research, which could be even more interesting in the future, but it still has security and performance problems, compare \cite{Monique Ogburn} and \cite{Baiyu Li} for more information on this.
